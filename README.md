# Scheduling-App-Google-Script
This is the database spreadsheet for the scheduling app that was written for a bar. It utilizes a frontend app (spreadsheet) also written in JS (Google Script) and two Google Forms that are interconnect for this app to function. Currently, the roles in the schedule app can not be changed. If this scheduling app needed to be used for a business with completely different roles a future PR will be needed to make roles more dynamic.
